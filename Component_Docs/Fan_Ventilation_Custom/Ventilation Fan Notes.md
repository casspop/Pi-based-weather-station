### Ventilation Fan Notes

There is an occasional need for additional ventilation other than that provided by natural convection.

I used a small 5V fan I had scavenged from a laptop some years ago.  It is a 4-wire fan, which means it has a speed sensor, and can be controlled by a PWM output on the Pi.

This [replacement fan from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tested-Replacement-Cooling-Inspiron-CN-031TPT/dp/B07J4LFRYX/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=CN-031TPT&qid=1589416977&sr=8-2) should be a drop-in replacement for the fan I used. 

I printed custom mounting parts for this fan.  This means anyone else building this project will need to figure out how they're going to mount whatever fan they have to use for this particular application.

I could not find any documentation for the specific fan I had, but I did find a similar fan by the same manufacturer and have included the spec sheet on it here.

The sketch in the .jpg file comes from a YouTube video and was helpful in sorting out how to use the 4-wire fan in my project.

The final working wiring diagram is incorporated into the main schematic for the station.
